## Predicting Patient Medical Expenses  


**Project description:** 
This project aims at building a Machine Learning model which can predict a patient's medical expenses based on patient demographics and several characteristics. 

**Data:** 
The training dataset contains information on 1,338 patients. 
  
  It includes the following features: 
  
    Age: Patient's age
    Sex: Patient's sex
    BMI: Patient's Body Mass Index
    Children: How many children the patient has 
    Smoker: Whether the patient is a smoker or not 
    Region: Which region the patient is from (Northeast, Southeast, Soutwest, Northwest)
    
    
 **Steps:**
 
Data Analysis
Feature Engineering (handle categorical variables)
Feature Selection 
Build Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting models and compare their performance
